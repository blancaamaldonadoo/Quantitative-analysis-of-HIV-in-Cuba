# Quantitative-analysis-of-HIV-in-Cuba
This repository contains the implementation of mathematical models to analyze the HIV epidemic in Cuba, including SIR-based extensions (XYZ and SXYZ models). The code explores the limitations of classical compartmental models and evaluates their ability to simultaneously describe HIV and AIDS dynamics.
